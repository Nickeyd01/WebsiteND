                    <h3>Efficient Multiparty Entanglement Distribution with DODAG-X Protocol</h3>
                    <p>Jan 2024 - Aug 2024</p>
                    <p>
                        In this work we introduce the DODAG-X protocol for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum networks. 
                        Leveraging the power of Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs), our protocol optimizes resource 
                        consumption and enhances robustness to noise in dynamic and lossy networks. Implementing a variation on the X-protocol 
                        within the DODAG, we minimize graph verification and path-finding calculations, significantly reducing computational 
                        overhead when compared to other entanglement routing schemes. Additionally, our benchmarks on grid lattice and small-world 
                        topologies reveal substantial measurement reduction compared to existing protocols. We demonstrate the success of DODAG-X 
                        for generating maximal three-party entanglement in arbitrary networks, and describe the potential for scaling to generic 
                        n-party entanglement. The DODAG-X protocol provides a scalable and efficient solution for entanglement routing, advancing 
                        current techniques for reliable quantum communication and network applications.

                    <h3>Design of an Efficient Silicon Nitride Grating Coupler</h3>
                    <p>Feb 2022 - Aug 2022</p>
                    <p>
                        This project was conducted as part of my Bachelor Thesis at ETH Zurich during my last semester at the Institute of 
                        Electromagnetic Fields under the supervision of Prof. Juerg Leuthold, Manuel Kohli and Boris Vukovic. The project 
                        consisted of exploring the potential uses of silicon nitride as an alternative platform for photonic integrated circuits 
                        as it shows tremendous promise due to low propagation losses, CMOS compatibility, and ability to handle high input power, 
                        among others. The first fundamental challenge was to understand the coupling from optical fibers to the nano- and 
                        microscale photonic waveguides. The thesis concentrated on the interface between fibers and integrated circuits so called 
                        couplers, specifically grating couplers, and on how to make them more efficient. In this work, a silicon nitride based 
                        grating coupler was demonstrated with a coupling efficiency below 0.5 dB using a back reflector. Using amorphous silicon 
                        as overlay gratings, a 1-dB Bandwidth of 40 nm is achieved. The development of efficient coupling at the interface was 
                        and remains a vital step to harness the full potential of photonic integrated circuits.

                    <h3>Design of Novel Coupling Methods for High-Speed Plasmonic Devices</h3>
                    <p>Sep 2021 - Feb 2022</p>
                    <p>
                        This project was part of my studies at ETH Zurich in the form of a group project with Martin Stecher. The project was done
                         in my 5th semester in the Institute of Electromagnetic fields under the supervision of Prof. Juerg Leuthold. The project 
                         investigated the principles of efficient and fast data communication with plasmonic- and optical technology. Our thesis 
                         concentrated on the principles of plasmonics, which are well suited with the integration of several platforms such as 
                         silicon photonics. With the use of two vertical plasmonic coupler approaches, we aimed to demonstrate two new ways to 
                         efficiently couple from a photonic waveguide directly into a plasmonic slot, which would allow the efficient integration 
                         into on-chip devices. One approach was based on a grating coupler where gratings made of gold are used as the foundation 
                         for coupling into a plasmonic MIM (metal-insulator-metal) slot and a tapered coupler with changing dimensions to maximize 
                         efficiency.

                        The aim of this program is to empower mathematics to change quantum information science, and to explore the rich overlap 
                        between pure and applied mathematical sciences and quantum information science. The broad goal was to cultivate and 
                        amplify the impact of mathematical sciences on quantum information science, and, conversely, to grow the impact of 
                        quantum information science on mathematics. The program explored both how pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and 
                        data science can be applied to define and understand new concepts that arise in quantum information science and the 
                        quantum description of complex phenomena. Among the important challenges addressed in the program wee the effort to 
                        understand fully what are the new capabilities that quantum models for computation offer beyond classical models. Another 
                        important challenge is that of describing the structure and dynamics of complex quantum systems. A third challenge is 
                        understanding where quantum information science can address current limitations in applied mathematics, data science, 
                        and numerical simulation.
